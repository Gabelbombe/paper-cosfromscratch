# Defining and Building a Container Orchestration System

In this paper I will be explaining why HashiCorp Nomad is a chosen core component of a cluster orchestration system, how the architecture of such a system could look like and discuss the components covering some of the most important topics like job scheduling, service discovery and load balancing/routing of ingress traffic.

Later I will show you how to set up the Container Orchestration System as it is I have outlined. The whole setup will be made using Terraform on an empty AWS account to ensure that it can be automated, reproduced and thus easily maintainable. The goal is to have a complete, [soup to nuts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soup_to_nuts) platform where services can be deployed and managed easily.
